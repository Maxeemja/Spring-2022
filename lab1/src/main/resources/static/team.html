            Our team consists of three people: <b>Max, Ivanna and Vitaly.</b> We all study in the same group.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although we are all in the same team but everyone are interested in different directions in programming.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, Max Hrytsyuk likes front-end development. <br>
            Ivanna Shevchuk is currently learning the .Net framework. <br>
            Vitaly Huziy is interested in various areas, such as: the Java programming language, JavaScript, swimming, and so on.
